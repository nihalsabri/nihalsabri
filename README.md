## 🌱 About Me

I'm a frontend developer who blends **space domain knowledge** with **modern UI/UX principles**.  
I create clean, organized, and real-time dashboards that transform complex orbital and space weather data into **clear, actionable insights**.

My projects include:
- 🛰️ **Live ISS Tracker** – Real-time satellite position & telemetry
- ☀️ **Solar Pulse** – Space weather monitoring with NOAA/NASA data
- 📡 **Mission Control Simulator** – Satellite health & communication UI

I believe the future of space exploration depends not just on rockets — but on **the software that makes their data understandable**.
